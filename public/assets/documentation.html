This app was designed to help visualize and edit an HL7 message. To get started click the &apos;Load&apos; button below to
choose a message file from disk. The app will analyze the message and display it in the Message Display section.

<strong>Message Display</strong>: Once a message is loaded it will be displayed here in a color coded format.
You can hover over any element to get a little detail about it, or click any element to edit it.
</p>
<p>
If you edit an encoding character in MSH-1 or MSH-2 that change will automatically propogate through the message
</p>
<p>
If the element you edit matches any other text in the message you will be prompted to replace the text elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Detail Display</strong>: To the right of the message display (or below on smaller screens) you will see the detail display.  
When a message first loads this is where the default search will show up.  If you search the message using the search field at the bottom
the results will display below the default elements.
